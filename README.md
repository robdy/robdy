### Hi there, I'm Rob 👋
I'd name myself 🤖 a scripting guy 🤖, rather than a developer, but I like to learn new languages. This is how I challenge myself.

🎓 Currently I'm playing with React and Gatsby in 📰 [my blog](https://robdy.io) 📰.

My main areas of expertise is Microsoft Teams, Skype for Business, Microsoft 365 and PowerShell
